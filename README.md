# Godot 2D Rogue-Lite Game [Work In Progress]

Solo Project for CSUMB Capstone

## Description
The intent for this game was to create a 2D rogue-lite game in the Godot 4 engine, similar to games like Vampire Survivors, with attack modification elements from games like Enter the Gungeon or Path of Exile.
After about 6 months of work in between classwork and group projects, the game is currently unfinished but the base components have been laid out for future development. 
Recently I redesigned some of the base features to utilize composition and inheritance to easily implement new versions of the same features later on, such as enemies and weapons. 


There is a playable early development demo (as of 08/04/2024) hosted on my Itch.io page here:

## Hub Area
The player starts in a hub area with 3 main npcs. 2 of those are merchants that the player can interact with to purchase equipment and permanant stat upgrades.

## Combat
The combat of the game is pretty simple. Weapons can have a primary and secondary attack which both have their own upgrade slots.

### Upgrades
The upgrades are earned after leveling up, by fighting enemies and collecting pickups on the ground. Upgrades can be simple and change base stats like damage and attack speed or can alter the pattern of the projectile, like forking and spreading projectiles.
