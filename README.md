# Godot 2D Rogue-Lite Game [Work In Progress]

Solo Project for CSUMB Capstone

## Description
The intent for this game was to create a 2D rogue-lite game in the Godot 4 engine, similar to games like Vampire Survivors, with attack modification elements from games like Enter the Gungeon or Path of Exile.
After about 3 months of work in between classwork and group projects, the game is currently unfinished but the base components have been laid out for future development. 
Recently I redesigned some of the base features to utilize composition and inheritance to easily implement new versions of the same features later on, such as enemies and weapons. 


There is a playable early development demo (as of 04/30/2024) hosted on my Itch.io page here:
